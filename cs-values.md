Hi there! I'm Parth Sarin, a student with the Graduate School of Education, and I'm really interested in why different students have different experiences in a class. I'm writing my thesis on student identity and belonging, and as part of the study I want to work with people like you to understand your experience in the course.

## 🍪 logistics

The study will consist of three interviews over the course of the quarter (each around 45m–1hr). In addition to helping out with the research question, I'll bake you cookies!! My friend has a great cookie recipe 😊

## 📜 disclaimer

I’m not affiliated with the CS 106A staff at all. I have no contact with them on a day-to-day basis. I’m not involved in the evaluation or grading of this course. I don’t set the curriculum. And, the opposite is true. The CS 106A staff aren’t involved in this study.

Your participation or non-participation in this study will not affect your grade in the course
