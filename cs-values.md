Hi there! I'm Parth, a student with the Graduate School of Education. I'm writing my thesis on student identity and belonging in 106A. As part of the study I want to work with people like you to understand your experience in the course.

This project can help future students taking this course or majoring in CS: understanding what promotes or harms belonging in 106A allows us to improve future versions of the course. And, if you participate, ***I'll bake you cookies!*** My friend has a great cookie recipe 😊

## 📣 reach out!

## 🗓 logistics

The study will consist of three interviews over the course of the quarter (each around 45m–1hr). The interviews will be recorded and the recordings will later be transcribed and anonymized. And, of course, I'll bake you cookies for each interview.
