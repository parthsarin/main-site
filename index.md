## 🧑🏽‍🏫 about me

<img src="/img/me.png" class="logo" alt="me standing in front of the golden gate bridge">

These days, I spend a lot of my time thinking about the intersection of computer science and education. This includes quantitative methods used in policy-making and also designing curricula to teach CS.

A random collection of additional facts:

* I have ten stuffed unicorns and one real one
* When I'm on campus, I like picking fruit off of trees and cooking with it
* As a kid, I fostered 9 kittens and named them after the US Supreme Court

## 🚀 projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

* [gibberish](/projects/gibberish) displays idioms in languages that reference another language as "gibberish" (e.g. "That's Greek to me")
* the [autograder](https://github.com/stanfordpython/autograder) we use for CS 41 has advanced testing capabilities to capture and run student code
* michael and I built the [Stanford Python website](https://stanfordpython.com/) in React.js with some nice, dynamic routing
* I designed one unit of a [data science curriculum](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T-Sac5lAUekTRNtVg8OOC2nXx8SefRZHRK38JCv3V6I/edit) for high schoolers
* I worked at [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) as an instructor, teaching CS interview skills to mostly FLI & BIPOC college students
* here's [the slide deck](/files/mathfest-2017-tensor-talk.pdf) for an award-winning talk I gave at MathFest 2017—it was about the application of tensor networks to phylogenetics
