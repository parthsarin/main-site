## 🧑🏽‍🏫 about me

<img src="/img/me.png" class="logo" alt="me standing in front of the golden gate bridge">

These days, I'm interested in how we can use technology to make education, particularly computing education, more equitable and accessible. Lately, this has involved thinking about student conceptions of artificial intelligence and building curriculum about its social implications.

A random collection of additional facts:

* I have eleven stuffed unicorns and one real one
* As a kid, I fostered 9 kittens and named them after the US Supreme Court
* Last summer, I biked across the US and taught math to kids along the way

## 🚀 projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

* in collaboration with teachers, we're building a [suite of resources](https://craft.stanford.edu/) that teachers can use to teach AI (warning: they're all in progress)
* i'm occasionally in Scotland, helping develop computing curriculum — in the latest trip, we worked on AI ethics and [debiasing algorithms](https://debias.netlify.app/)
* when i taught cs 41 with the lovely [michael cooper](https://michaeljohncooper.com/) we built an [autograder](https://github.com/stanfordpython/autograder) for the course that can run student code and try to explain what went wrong in plain English
* [gibberish](/projects/gibberish) displays idioms in languages that reference another language as "gibberish" (e.g. "That's Greek to me")
* i worked at [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) as an instructor, teaching CS interview skills to mostly FLI & BIPOC college students
* here's [the slide deck](/files/mathfest-2017-tensor-talk.pdf) for an award-winning talk I gave at MathFest 2017—it was about the application of tensor networks to phylogenetics
