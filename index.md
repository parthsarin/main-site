## about me

These days, I spend a lot of my time thinking about how we can combine computer science and education. This includes quantitative methods used in policy-making and also designing curricula to teach CS and data science in K-12 schools.

I'm generally pretty passionate about the intersection between data and policy, and how to navigate it ethically.

A random collection of additional facts:

* I have ten stuffed unicorns and one real one
* When I'm on campus, I like picking fruit off of trees and cooking with it
* As a kid, I fostered 9 kittens and named them after the US Supreme Court

## projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

* [gibberish](/projects/gibberish) displays idioms in languages that reference another language as "gibberish" (e.g. "That's Greek to me")
* the [autograder](https://github.com/stanfordpython/autograder) we use for CS 41 has advanced testing capabilities to capture and run student code
* michael and I built the [Stanford Python website](https://stanfordpython.com/) in React.js with some nice, dynamic routing
* I'm working on a [data science curriculum](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T-Sac5lAUekTRNtVg8OOC2nXx8SefRZHRK38JCv3V6I/edit) for high schoolers
* I work at [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) as an instructor, teaching CS interview skills to mostly FLI & BIPOC college students
