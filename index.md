## 🧑🏽‍🏫 about me

<img src="/img/me.png" class="logo" alt="me with dyed hair standing in front of a mural">

These days, I'm interested in how we can use technology to make education, particularly computing education, more equitable and accessible. In a recent project, this has involved co-designing curricula about artificial intelligence with teachers, thinking about student conceptions of AI, and creating entry points into the topic from the perspectives of many different disciplines.

A random collection of additional facts:

* I have eleven stuffed unicorns and one real one
* I'm [mortally terrified](https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/the-duolingo-owl) of owls
* Last summer, I biked across the US and taught math to kids along the way

I was really fortunate to be featured in [this lovely spotlight about some of my recent work](https://youtu.be/s6aH1LtFzno) 😊

## 🚀 projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of.

* in collaboration with teachers, we're building a [suite of resources](https://craft.stanford.edu/) that teachers can use to teach AI
* i'm occasionally in Scotland, helping develop computing curriculum — in the latest trip, we worked on AI ethics and [debiasing algorithms](https://debias.netlify.app/)
* when i taught cs 41 with the lovely [michael cooper](https://michaeljohncooper.com/) we built an [autograder](https://github.com/stanfordpython/autograder) for the course that can run student code and try to explain what went wrong in plain English
* [gibberish](/projects/gibberish) displays idioms in languages that reference another language as "gibberish" (e.g. "That's Greek to me")
* i worked at [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) as an instructor, teaching CS interview skills to mostly FLI & BIPOC college students
* here's [the slide deck](/files/mathfest-2017-tensor-talk.pdf) for an award-winning talk I gave at MathFest 2017—it was about the application of tensor networks to phylogenetics
