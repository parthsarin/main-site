## about me

These days, I spend a lot of my time thinking about how we can combine computer science and education. This includes quantitative methods used in policy-making and also designing curricula to teach CS and data science in K-12 schools.

I'm generally pretty passionate about the intersection between data and policy, and how to navigate it ethically.

A random collection of additional facts:

* I have ten stuffed unicorns and one real one
* When I'm on campus, I like picking fruit off of trees and cooking with it
* As a kid, I fostered 9 kittens and named them after the US Supreme Court
